I got this error from the following code:

```typescript
export async function downloadFile(fileID: string): Promise<void> {
    const token = Cookies.get("tokenHxb")!;
    const client = await getHexabaseClient(token);
    if (!client) {
        console.error("download failed: failed to get client");
        return;
    }

    // the error occurs inside client.download
    const file = await client.download(fileID);

    //...
}
```

The first thing I can tell from the callstack is it seems to be happening in the API call. More specifically, this line:

https://github.com/hexabase/hexabase-js/blob/31fa255ed184e0e73d37bfcda8eaa9979fbfeb1e/src/HxbAbstract.ts#L70

When debugging and stepping through the (transpiled javascript) code of `FileObject.download()`, I see that the data in the Rest API is the following:

```
body = '{}'
headers = {Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCâ€¦DuCCjjEA96j1Eb2Ze1FhrF_IHrcmaqJXw9Mxs0ySw', Content-Type: 'application/json'}
method = 'get'
```

In the source code for `FileObject.download()`, it looks like the method set is `"get"`, and there is an empty object provided as the body. Maybe this is the cause of the error we are getting?

```typescript
async download(): Promise<Blob> {
    if (this.data) return this.data;
    const res = await this.rest('get', `/api/v0/files/${this.id}`, {}, {}, {response: 'blob'});
    this.set('data', res as Blob);
    return res;
}
```
